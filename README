While worrying about what the undo method should return it hit me that this probably still won't end up functional enough. For the sake of programmer's time I am going to end up maintaining two parallel states, which starts to defeat the purpose of using Angular in the first place.
In an attempt to only absorb one new tech a time, I have written most of index.html (everything but the new puzzle inputter) first.
Holy Shit!
